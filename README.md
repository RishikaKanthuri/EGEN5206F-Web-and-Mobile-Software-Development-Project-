We built a web appilcation named "Smart Talent Hire" which can be used by candidates to search, apply and get hired for jobs by getting registered. Panelists will be able to login and provide feedback to the candidates they interviewed. Hiring Managers will be able to find the employees they require by using this app.

### Roles:
1. Candidate: an individual looking for a job opportunity.

   Duties: Registration, Log In and Apply for Jobs.
2. Panelist: a person who interviews the candidates and provides feedback.

   Duties: Registration, Log In, View Assigned Candidate’s information and Provide Feedback.
3. Hiring Manager (Admin): a person who handles the assignment of a registered candidate to a panelist to schedule the interview.

    Duties: View all the panelists and candidates’ data and assign each other accordingly for interviews.

### DETAILED STEP-WISE TOUR OF THE APP

* Step1: Open the home page and Sign Up as a candidate and get registered.
* Step2: Go to View Jobs Page and apply for a job.

  Note: Remember the job you applied for because while registering as a panelist you need to choose the same interview as candidate and panelist with same interview only can be assigned.
* Step3: Navigate back to home page and SignUp as a panelist.
* Step4: Click on the Hiring Manager tab on the Nav bar on the home page and login with the following credentials:
