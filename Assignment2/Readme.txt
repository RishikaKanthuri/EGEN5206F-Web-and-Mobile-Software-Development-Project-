We have added the API using Nest JS and MongoDB. 
There are four modules
1. candidate
2. panelist
3. interview
4. assign
The candidate data is created when we sign up using the signup form in the home page. After signing up you can use the candidate email id to sign in to the specific candidate page. For now you just need to enter email in email address input and no need to enter the password. Click on Sign In and you will be directed to candidate's page.
The panelist data is hard-coded and already stored.
If you want to login to the panelist page.
use this email address: alice@smarttalent.com - to understand the structure of the page.

Similarly, when you enter the email address of panelist on the panelist login form, it will direct you to the panelist page where you can see upcoming interviews and candidates lined up for interviews, also the feedback forms but candidates will be visible only after assigning which will be done in the hiring manager page.
You will find it in the nav bar on home page- to log in to hiring manager page use the following credentials.
username: admin
password: admin123

There you can assign candidates to panelist.
The main home page of the application is 'homePage/home.html'.
