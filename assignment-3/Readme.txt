We have added authentication and authorization to the api.
We mainly have two roles 
1. candidate
2. panelist
So, candidate can be registered using the signup form on the home page.
We created a new module named "auth" in the project-api in which the authentication is done.
There is also a hiring manager and the link to login will be found in the navbar on the home page.
Credentials:
username: admin
password: admin123
You can view the admin page by providing these inputs.
A panelist cannot be signed up so to login, we can provide you with one of our panelist details
email address: alice@smarttalent.com
password: alice@123.

A panelist contains the details of interviews and respective candidates. To assign candidates login to hiring manage page and it will be done. Eventually, you will find the candidate details on the panelist page.
On the interviews page, you need to apply for the interviews.

Steps for a detailed tour to the application:
"Home page - homePage/home.html"
1.Sign up using candidate signup form and go to "View Jobs" page and apply for an interview providing required details.
2. Sign In to the candidates page so that you can view your details.(candidate crendentials are the same used while signing up).
3. Sign In to hiring manager page and assign panelist to candidates.
4. Now, log in to the panelist page, view the details and provide feedback to the candidates.
