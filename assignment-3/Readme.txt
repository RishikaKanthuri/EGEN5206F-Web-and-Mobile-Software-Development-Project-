There are two pages named homePage and panelist page but many other pages are linked in them. I have made different folders for each of them. So, I recommend you to download the entire Assignment1 folder and open in VS code as the paths are given this way.
homePage - this folder contains all the pages used in home Page
panelist - this folder consists all the oages used in panelist page.
photos - this folder contains all the images used in the application.
Similarly, admin, interview and candidate are the folders of other pages.
All these folders must be opened together in a single folder 'Assignment1' to get directed correctly.
You can just download the Assignment1 folder and open directly on VSCode and run.
